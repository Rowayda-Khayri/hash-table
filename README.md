# hash-table
The primary operation a hash table should support efficiently is a lookup: given a key (e.g. a
person's name), find the corresponding value (e.g. that person's telephone). It works by transforming
the key using a hash function into a hash, a number that the hash table uses to locate the desired
value. This hash maps directly to a bucket in the array of key/value pairs, hence the name hash map.
The mapping method lets us directly access the storage location for any key/value pair.
